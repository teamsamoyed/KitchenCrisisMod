# Upload mod

After you've completed creating your mod, you can upload your mod to the Steam Workshop using the mod uploader.

Mod uploads can be done using the ModUploader program located under (the folder where Kitchen Crisis is installed).

You can select the mode to upload using the combo box at the top.

After selecting a mode, click the upload button to start uploading to the Steam Workshop. If you want to update a previously uploaded mode, write the ID of the uploaded mode in workshop ID and click the upload button.

To upload a mod, you must agree to Steam's [workshop terms of service](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/workshoplegalagreement).

After uploading, you must set the uploaded mod to public publishing on Steam's Workshop page to make your mod visible to others. Please note that your content will not appear in the Workshop until you set up public publishing yourself.
